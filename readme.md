# Sync projectplace workspace data

## 1. Set up config.json

First of all you need to request a "robot" from Projectplace. This is only applicable for Projectplace enterprise 
accounts. Then enter the information you received from projectplace in config.json as follows:

    {
        "consumer_key": "ENTER YOUR APPLICATION KEY",
        "consumer_secret": "ENTER YOUR APPLCIATION SECRET",
        "tokey_key": "ENTER YOUR TOKEN KEY",
        "token_secret": "ENTER YOUR TOKEN SECRET"
    }
